    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW or Web) is a system of interlinked hypertext documents that can be accessed via the <a href="wikipedia.html" target="_blank"">Internet</a> . It was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while working at CERN, the European particle physics laboratory.</p>

    <p>The World Wide Web operates on a client-server model, where users (clients) access <a href="wikipedia.html" target="_blank"">information</a> hosted on remote servers. When a user wants to view a website, they enter a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in their browser, which acts as a client.
     This URL is linked to a server <a href="wikipedia.html" target="_blank"">where</a> the requested web page is stored. The browser sends a request to the server, which responds by delivering the webpage, allowing users to view content such as text, images, and videos. 
     Web browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari render these pages using HTML and CSS to present the information visually. Additionally, interactive elements like forms, buttons, and media are powered by scripts written in languages like JavaScript.</p>
